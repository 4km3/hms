# Description

The target of this beginner's course is to learn a few of the basic techniques
that allow you to survive when you start to develop a microservices architecture.

---

The first day is focused in the development process, we will introduce the main characteristics of this kind
of architecture and some basic techniques ATDD, TDD, docker and CI.

---

In the second day we will deep dive in the microservices concepts, we will study how to split a monolith in multiple microservices and
how to deploy and scale them in a modern PaaS platform like Rancher.

---

The subject of the last day is continuous delivery, we will develop a deployment pipeline to put your
microservices safely in production.
