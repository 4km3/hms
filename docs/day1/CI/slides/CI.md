### Continuous Integration (CI) crash course

---

- CI is a practice that aims to prevent integration problems, aka “integration hell”

---

- In order to build but the most trivial pieces of software, multiple steps are often required

---

- These steps, collectively, can be understood as “build pipelines”

---

- CI techniques allows these build pipelines to be fully automated
	- Automation reduces the build time
	- Also minimizes the chance of human error

---

- self-testing code is essential, otherwise feedback won't be available (did it fail? did it not? I'll ask my dog, then)

---

- A consecuence of CI is that the code can be rolled into production with little extra effort.  We'll talk tomorrow about this.

---

### Safer Pipelines

- CI allows to detect:
	- Bugs in the commited code early on the development cycle
	- Issues when integrating with other developers' code
- Frequent commits to Mainline
- Safety will be as good as the test suite
- Enables visual feedback on the build status
- Test environment must be as close as possible to production

---

### Faster Pipelines

- Automation in the process makes it seamless
- Also eliminates the human-induced bugs
- Fast pipelines require reasonably fast builds (10' is a good target)

---

### Process Overview (server side)

- Developers commit source code to an SCM
- A CI tool checks out the changes uploaded to the SCM
- It then runs a batch of tests over the new code
- If all tests are passed, the artifacts produced are then versioned and made available
- The feedback of the build process is made available to the developers

---

### Jenkins CI

- Jenkins is an open source extensible automation server
- Supports popular SCM tools 
- Built around the concept of pipelines
- Pipelines enable software lifecycle management
- Its point & click interface is at odds with good CI principles
- Jenkins developers recognized this and adopted a DSL based pipeline description system

---

### Jenkins CI

- Supports ant, maven, gradle for building automation
- Unit and acceptance testing are supported 
- Jenkins supports developer notifications via e-mail, info radiator, etc
- Jenkins supports plugins to extend its capabilities

---

## Practice

- Automate the integration of the code available in your forked repo from hms-code
- For that purpose, we will use Jenkins as our CI tool
- Jenkins will check over your GitHub repo and then run the tests included in the code
- After the tests have been run it will show the tests tendency graphs and provide the resulting artifacts

---

## Step 1

- Configure GitHub Service
- Inside your repo settings, 'Integrations & Services' block, select 'Add Service'
- Search for Jenkins, and select 'Jenkins (Git Plugin)'
- Fill in your specific Jenkins URL (http://jenkins.hms.rawmind.net/)

---

## Step 2

- Setup a new freestyle project
- In SCM, enable Git and fill in your repo URL
- Activate Poll SCM with no further options
- Tick on 'Build Enviroment' > 'Delete workspace before build starts'

---

## Step 3

- Add a build step 'Execute shell' class
- Fill it with this script

```
cd ci
/var/jenkins_home/tools/hudson.tasks.Maven_MavenInstallation/mvn/bin/mvn \
clean test package

```

---

## Step 4

- Add two postbuild actions:
- First 'Archive the artifacts' with value '\*\*/target/\*.jar'
- Second 'Publish JUnit test result report' with value '\*\*/target/surefire-reports/TEST-\*.xml'

- Now try make some changes to your repo locally and then pushing them to GitHub.
- Check what happens in your Jenkins web view
