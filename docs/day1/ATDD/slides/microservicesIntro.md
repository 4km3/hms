### Practice 1

#### Get the code

In this practice we obtain the code for the course and check your laptop configuration.
* Login in your GitHub account and fork the repository https://github.com/4km3/hms-code.git
* Clone your forked repo in your laptop.
  * git clone https://github.com/(username)/hms-code.git
* Open a terminal console.
* git checkout atdd
* cd yourProjectDirectory/atdd

### Microservices

---

Is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms,
often an HTTP resource API.

---

Organized around Business Capabilities

---

Products not Projects

---

Smart endpoints and dumb pipes

---

Decentralized Governance

---

Decentralized Data Management

---

Infrastructure Automation
