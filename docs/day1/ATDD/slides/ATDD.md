### ATDD

Analogous to test-driven development, Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) involves team members
with different perspectives (customer, development, testing) collaborating to write acceptance tests
in advance of implementing the corresponding functionality

---

### Why does it matter?

* It's a new way to communicate between business and developers.
* Allows evolutionary architecture.
* Defines what the system do, not how.
* Creates living documentation.

---

* Generate a set of regression tests.
* Acceptance tests ensure you build the right thing.
* They are executable specifications.
* They become the definitive source of truth as to what the system does.

---

### What is a user story?

A user story describes functionality that will be valuable to either a user or purchaser of a system or software.

---

### Characteristics

* Card: A written description of the story used for planning and as a reminder.
* Conversations: About the story that serve to flesh out the details of the story.
* Tests that convey and document details and that can be used to determine when a story is complete.

---

### Characteristics of a good user story

* Independent: Should be self-contained, there is no inherent dependency on another story.
* Negotiable: Stories are not explicit contracts.
* Valuable: A story must deliver value.
* Estimable: You must always be able to estimate the size of a story.
* Small: Stories should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize.
* Testable: The story or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.

---

### Practice 1
    
#### Find the user stories in the code

* Open the code in your IDE.
  * Browse to yourProjectDirectory/atdd/acceptance-test/src/test/resources/features/customers (in the atdd branch)
  * Open createCustomer.feature.

### A simple scenario

```
Background:
    Given a customers with the following data:
      | id      | identityCard | name   | lastName  | email                           | phone     | avatar  |
      | abcdefg | 79986535X    | Alfred | Hitchcock | alfred.hitchcock@indiscreet.com | 636561241 | potatoe |

  Scenario: Register a new person successfully
    When a person is registered in the system with the following data:
      | id                  | name | lastName | idCard    | email         | termsAndConditions | mobilePhone |
      | 43r34t-rgertwe-rw43 | Bart | Simpson  | 50861048K | lmb@gmail.com | true               | 636589713   |
    Then the response must be "CREATED"
    And the response has links to
      | link | api        | href   |
      | self | ari-read | api/me |
    And therefore, it exists a customer, identified by "43r34t-rgertwe-rw43" with the following data:
      | name | lastName | idCard    | email         |
      | Bart | Simpson  | 50861048K | lmb@gmail.com |
    And the customer "50861048K" has the following limits into its bucks:
      | rechargeThisPeriod | rechargeLast | rechargeRemaining | rechargeMax |
      | 0.0 EUR            | 0.0 EUR      | 2500.0 EUR        | 2500.0 EUR  |

```

### Cucumber

Cucumber is a behavior-driven development (BDD) test automation tool. The first implementation
was made by the ruby community. Now there are versions in many languages like java, javascript, etc.
Is the most extended tool in BDD

---

### Gherkin

Gherkin is plain-text English (or one of 60+ other languages) with a little extra structure.

Gherkin is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, yet structured enough to allow concise
description of examples to illustrate business rules in most real-world domains.

---

### Practice 2

### Execute acceptance test

* Open a terminal console.
* Execute:
  * echo '127.0.0.1 ari' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
  * cd yourProjectDirectory/atdd (in the atdd branch)
  * mvn clean package
  * java -jar target/ari-0.1.0.jar

### Feature

Is supposed to describe a single feature of the system, or a particular aspect of a feature.
It's just a way to provide a high-level description of a software feature, and to group related scenarios.

A feature has three basic elements:

* The Feature: keyword.
* A name (on the same line).
* An optional (but highly recommended) description that can span multiple lines.

---

### Scenario

A scenario is a concrete example that illustrates a business rule. It consists of a list of steps.

* You can have as many steps as you like, but we recommend you keep the number at 3-5 per scenario.
* If they become longer than that they lose their expressive power as specification and documentation.

---

### Step definitions

* Given: Are used to describe the initial context of the system.
* When: Are used to describe an event, or an action.
* Then: steps are used to describe an expected outcome, or result.

---

### Practice 3

### Add new scenario to existing feature

* Open the code in your IDE.
  * Browse to yourProjectDirectory/atdd/acceptance-test/src/test/resources/features/customers (in the atdd branch)
  * Open createCustomer.feature.
  * Copy the scenario into createCustomer.feature

---

```

Scenario: Conflict when a customer exists with the given idCard
    When a person is registered in the system with the following data:
      | id         | name | lastName | idCard    | email         | termsAndConditions |
      | lahdsfalsd | Bart | Simpson  | 79986535X | lmb@gmail.com | true               |
    Then the response must be "CONFLICT"
    And the response has the following data
      | code           | description                                                       |
      | existingIdCard | Attempting to create a customer with an existing idCard:79986535X |

### Lesson learned

* All the team must write the features together.
* Test must be independent. Avoid test wars.
* Keep the test DRY.
* Try to keep the feature declarative.
* Asynchronous interfaces are hard to test.
* Don't access directly to the database front test.
