### Antifragile

Or how complex systems behave when is exposed to the randomness.

---

### Randomness

Uncertainty, variability, imperfect or incomplete knowledge, change, chaos,
disorder, entropy, time, the unknown, stressor, error, volatility.

---

### Type of complex systems

---

#### Fragile

A fragile system doesn't like volatility. It is fragile because it wants calm and predictability.
For instance a cup.

Fragile system never improve. Disorder and time make fragile systems decay.

---

#### Resilient

System don't affected by the disorder. Solid, immutable, static systems.

---

#### Antifragile

The opposite of fragile, system that became better with randomness and disorder.

### Example: Trading

---

#### Small shops

* Every shop is autonomous. It shares nothing with other shops.
* It is decentralized, there is not a central authority deciding if a new shop opens.
* People can decide freely in which shop they buy.
* If a shop doesn't fulfill the customers expectations the shop closes.
* Every shop is fragile, but the overall system is better with changes.

---

#### Mall

* The mall provides to the shops many services, security, cleaning service, etc..
* The mall's owner decide which shops opens in the mall.
* Every shop decide which product sell and its selling strategy.
* The shop's owner manage the finances of the shop.
* If the mall infrastructure fails all the shops is affected.

---

#### Department store

* The department store sells many different kind of products.
* All the infrastructure is shared.
* The owner of the department store decides which product sell.

---

* Optimization destroy redundancies and generate fragility.
* Redundancies generate antifragility but elevate the system cost.
* Risks are infinite and you can imagine all of them, search you system fragile points.

---

### Examples

* Evolution.
* Decentralized states.
* Lean startUp.

---

#### In software:

* Open source community.
* (Real) Agile development.
* Microservices.
* Chaos engineering.
