The Only Thing That Is Constant Is Change

### Evolutionary architecture

An evolutionary architecture supports incremental, guided change as a first
principle along multiple dimensions.

### Characteristics

#### Modularity and Coupling
Support for modularity, often at the technical architecture,enables separating components along well defined boundaries.

#### Organized Around Business Capabilities
Modularity at the domain level is increasingly done using Domain-Driven Design.

#### Experimentation
Changes to an application becomes trivial allowing for A/B testing and Canary releases, among others.
This allows for experimentation and ultimately enables usage of Hypothesis-Driven Development.

### Principles

#### Last Responsible Moment

We wait for the last responsible moment before making decisions.
Deciding when that moment occurs can be hard.

#### Bring the Pain Forward

Doing things in a project that may cause pain earlier and more often will more rapidly
identify the issues causing this and will encourage automation to remove the pain.

#### Fitness Functions

An architectural fitness function specifies important characteristics of a system.
Examples include levels of uptime, throughput, availability and security needed.

### The city metaphor

* The town planner does his best to anticipate these changes, but accepts that trying to exert
direct control over all aspects of what happens is futile.
* More than one person has likened a city to a living creature.
* The city changes over time. It shifts and evolves as its occupants use it in different ways,
or as external forces shape it.
